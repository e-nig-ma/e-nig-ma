This website serves as a partial collection of essays and publications, primarily centred around my key areas of interest --information security, philosophy (and complex systems), and economics.

The areas and subfields I'm particularly, yet not exclusively, interested in are: secure protocols and cryptography; decision theory, rationality, and governance; free-markets and monetary economics.

Areas and fields of interest: information security (secure protocols, cryptography), economics (free-markets, history, monetary economics), philosophy and complex systems (decision theory, rationality, complexity, political theory, governance).

Literary fluency in Italian, Spanish, English, and Catalan; reading and speaking fluency also in Portuguese and French.

Temporary drop out of a bachelor's degree in computer science and a bachelor's degree in economics.
