This website serves as a partial collection of essays and publications, primarily centred around my key areas of interest --Information Security, Philosophy, and Economics.

The areas and subfields I'm particularly, yet not exclusively, interest in are: secure protocols and cryptography; decision theory, rationality, and governance; free-markets and monetary economics.

My areas and fields of interest are primarily three:
- Computer security (secure protocols, cryptography)
- Free-markets and monetary economics (history, free markets)
- Philosophy & Complex systems (decision theory, rationality, complexity, governance) 


Areas and fields of interest: computer security (secure protocols, cryptography), complex systems (decision theory, rationality, complexity), and monetary economics.

Literary fluency in Italian, Spanish, English, and Catalan; reading and speaking fluency also in Portuguese and French.

Temporary drop out of a bachelor's degree in computer science and a bachelor's degree in economics.

**Philosophy, Rationality, Decision Theory**
