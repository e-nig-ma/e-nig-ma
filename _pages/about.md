This site is a semi-complete archive of essays and papers I've written, primarily as an independent scholar.

My areas of interest are: computer security, primarily in the fields of secure protocols and cryptography; complex systems, essentially in decision theory, rationality, and complexity; and monetary economics.

My fields of interest are primarily three. Computer security (secure protocols, cryptography), complex systems (decision theory, rationality, complexity), and monetary economics.

Literary fluency in Italian, Spanish, English, and Catalan; reading and speaking fluency also in Portuguese and French.

Drop out --which is most likely temporary-- of BSc in Computer Science and BSc in Economics.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
